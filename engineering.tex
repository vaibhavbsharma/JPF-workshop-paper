\section{Engineering Challenges}
Talk about the engineering challenges we face when implementing veritesting with Symbolic PathFinder

Engineering issue \#1: Sharing implementation needs to be fixed. Show this using the TestSharing example

Engineering issue \#2: Need to have complex expressions, talk about how Comparators cannot be used anywhere below the top-level operator

Engineering issue \#3: Nice to introduce intermediate variables
